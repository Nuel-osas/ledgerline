/**
 * @title AttestBase — hardened replacement for the tutorial's USCBase
 * @dev USCBase (sponsor code, shipped byte-identical in this repo for comparison)
 * has two structural weaknesses that let an attacker make a genuine source-chain
 * event permanently unprovable. Both are exploited on live testnets by
 * the Deadswitch project (github.com/Nuel-osas/deadswitch) and filed upstream as
 * gluwa/USC-Builder-Examples#37.
 *
 *   1. ACTION-SELECTOR SUPPRESSION.
 *      USCBase.execute takes a caller-supplied `action` and burns the query as
 *      processed regardless of which logs the action consumed. The replay key is
 *      keccak(chainKey, blockHeight, txIndex) — `action` is NOT in it. So a
 *      borrower emits a deposit and a withdrawal in ONE transaction, submits it
 *      as a deposit, and the withdrawal in that same transaction can never be
 *      proven. Collateral leaves, the position stays healthy.
 *
 *      FIX: `action` is deleted from the external ABI. The action is derived from
 *      each log's own topics[0]. One transaction is consumed exactly once, and
 *      every relevant log inside it is applied, in log order.
 *
 *   2. DECOY-LOG CENSORSHIP.
 *      USCBase consumers read logs[0] and revert if it fails the emitter check.
 *      Prefixing a decoy event from a throwaway contract in the same transaction
 *      makes the genuine event permanently unprovable — the emitter guard becomes
 *      the censorship vector.
 *
 *      FIX: iterate ALL logs, skip those not from the registered source, never
 *      revert on a foreign log's presence.
 *
 * Also threads `blockHeight` into the handler so consumers can enforce staleness
 * ordering, which USCBase makes impossible (it passes only the queryId).
